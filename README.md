# AI_BIAN
This is an AI empowered interactive knowledge base for BIAN (Banking Industry Architecture Network)

## Overview
This document outlines the MVP requirements for an AI-powered knowledge base for BIAN (Banking Industry Architecture Network) standards and best practices. The solution leverages Vectorize.io's RAG pipeline and a responsive web interface.

## Problem Statement
Banking architects and developers need quick access to BIAN framework information, but:
1. BIAN documentation is complex and technical
2. Finding specific answers requires deep domain knowledge
3. Traditional search doesn't understand banking architecture context

## Solution Value Proposition
- Natural language interface to BIAN knowledge
- Context-aware responses with source citations
- Visual representation of service domain relationships
- Bilingual support (Chinese/English) for regional users

## MVP Scope

### Core Features
1. **Natural Language Search**
   - Accept banking architecture questions in plain language
   - Return BIAN-aligned responses with source references
   - Display related service domains and relationships

2. **Knowledge Presentation**
   - Structured answers with key points (similar to lines 392-448)
   - Interactive diagrams of service domain relationships (lines 414-430)
   - Term definitions with tooltips (lines 236-241)

3. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design (mobile/desktop)
   - Light/dark mode toggle (lines 149-169)
   - Example questions for discovery (lines 353-368)

### Technical Architecture
```
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) → API Gateway → Vectorize.io RAG Pipeline → BIAN Knowledge Base
```

### Data Requirements
- BIAN Service Landscape documentation (v12.0+)
- BIAN Service Domain definitions
- Common mapping patterns between BIAN and traditional banking systems

### Non-Goals (Post-MVP)
- User authentication
- Advanced analytics
- Custom knowledge ingestion
- Multi-user collaboration

## Success Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: >85% correct answers on BIAN domain questions
2. **Latency**: <2s response time for typical queries
3. **Adoption**: 50+ weekly active users in first month

## Timeline
| Milestone           | Duration | Deliverables |
|---------------------|----------|--------------|
| API Integration     | 1 week   | Working connection to Vectorize.io RAG |
| Frontend Completion | 2 weeks  | Responsive UI matching mockup (lines 1-500) |
| Testing & Tuning    | 1 week   | Accuracy improvements, performance optimization |
| MVP Launch          | -        | Public beta release |

## Open Questions
1. What are the most common BIAN questions from our target users?
2. Should we prioritize Chinese or English content first?
3. What additional banking architecture sources should we include?

## Next Steps
1. Finalize API specifications
2. Implement frontend-backend integration
3. Conduct user testing with banking architects
